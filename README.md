# StarterBot

This is a starter bot, obviously, you should know the basics in coding and discord, have git, Python, node, and a code editor[don't use notepad++ thats just...disappointing] i recommend Atom or Visual Studio Code from Microsoft{its free}
If you need help contact me on discord at dathidewolf#4041
Thats pretty much it.
have fun, please dont delete commands and/or text that credits me, it is there so people know who made the source code and that they can also get the source code if they want
